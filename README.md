# Harry Potter RPG!
## Instructions
Harry Potter RPG is a role playing game which allows the player to take on the role of one of the main characters from Harry Potter in a wizards duel.  Choose to be our hero Harry or one of his faithful friends, Ron or Hermione.  If you are feeling devious, you can also take on the darker role of Draco or even one of the villains, Bellatrix or Lord Voldemort.  Click on a character to select it.  
The other 5 characters then become defenders that you must defeat in order to win the game.  

Each character starts with a number of Health Points as indicated at the bottom of their picture.  Reduce the defender's health points to zero to win the duel.  Click on the attack button to begin the duel and for each successive attack on the defender.  Each time an attack takes place a message will indicate the number of health points deducted from the defender's total and the new total will be displayed.  The defender will counter attack as well and a message will also indicate how many health points this counter attack was good for.   Account carefully for the total number of health points because they will not be replenished during the course of the game but will need to last if all of the remaining defenders are to be defeated.

Once an enemy is defeated, choose another opponent and commence the battle.  Continue until all enemies have been defeated!
